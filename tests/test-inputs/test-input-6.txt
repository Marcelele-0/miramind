Hey buddy, I’ve got a super fun and sneaky plan! Let’s build a secret fort out of pillows and blankets in the living room—but we’ll call it our “Shenanigans HQ!” Once it’s done, we can make up silly spy codes to talk to each other like real undercover agents. Then, we’ll invite the stuffed animals for a top-secret meeting where we plan new adventures! What do you think? Ready for some mischief? 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️
