"Hey... I just feel really mad at my parents right now. They don’t understand me, and it’s like they’re not even trying to listen. I don’t know how to explain stuff to them without them getting upset or thinking I’m wrong. I just wish things were easier, you know? Like… why can’t they just get how I’m feeling? It’s not fair."
