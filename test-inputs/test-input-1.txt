Hi AI friend! Today was pretty busy for me. I went to school and did some hard stuff like math, but my teacher helped me a lot. At lunch, I sat with my friends, and we laughed about silly things. After school, I went to therapy, and we worked on calming down when I get upset. It was kind of tiring, but I did my best.

Now I’m feeling kind of wiggly inside, like my mind and body need a big hug. Can we talk about fun stuff or maybe play a little pretend game? That helps me relax. You’re good at talking to me—you make me feel understood, and that’s nice.
